== Preface ==

This book provides a quick introduction to Pyomo.  Pyomo is a
collection of Python software packages that supports a diverse set
of optimization capabilities for formulating and analyzing optimization
models.  A central component of Pyomo is Pyomo, which supports the
formulation and analysis of mathematical models for complex
optimization applications.  This capability is commonly associated
with algebraic modeling languages (AMLs), which support the description
and analysis of mathematical models with a high-level language.
Although most AMLs are implemented in custom modeling languages,
Pyomo's modeling objects are embedded within Python, a full-featured
high-level programming language that contains a rich set of supporting
libraries.

Pyomo has also proven an effective framework for developing high-level
optimization and analysis tools. For example, the PySP package
provides generic solvers for stochastic programming. PySP leverages
the fact that Pyomo's modeling objects are embedded within a
full-featured high-level programming language, which allows for
transparent parallelization of subproblems using Python parallel
communication libraries.

=== Goals of the Book ===

In this book, we provide a broad overview of different components
of the Pyomo software.  There are roughly two main goals for this
book:

1. Help users get started with different Pyomo capabilities:  Our
goal is not to provide a comprehensive reference, but rather to
provide a tutorial with simple and illustrative examples.  Also,
we aim to provide explanations behind the design and philosophy of
Pyomo.

2. Provide preliminary documentation of new features and capabilities
in Pyomo.  We know that a new feature or capability probably will
not be used unless it is documented.  As Pyomo evolves, we plan to
use this book to document these features.  This provides users some
context concerning the focus of Pyomo development, and it also
provides an opportunity to get early feedback on new features before
they are documented in other contexts.

=== Who Should Read This Book ===

This book is intended to be a reference for students, academic
researchers and practitioners.  Pyomo has been effectively used in
the classroom with undergraduate and graduate students.  However,
we assume that the reader is generally familiar with optimization
and mathematical modeling.  Although this book does not contain a
glossary, we recommend the Mathematical Programming Glossary <<MPG>>
as a reference for the reader.  We also assume that the reader is
generally familiar with the Python programming language.  There are
a variety of books describing Python, as well as excellent documentation
of the Python language and the software packages bundled with Python
distributions.


=== Comments and Questions ===

Further information about Pyomo and Pyomo is available on the Pyomo wiki:

    https://software.sandia.gov/trac/pyomo

Pyomo is also hosted at COIN-OR:

    https://projects.coin-or.org/Pyomo

We strongly encourage feedback from readers about the software on the Pyomo Forum:

    pyomo-forum@googlegroups.com

If you have comments about this pre-alpha rough draft of the book, please
send them to DLWoodruff@UCDavis.edu.
We hope this will include feedback on typos and errors in our
examples.  Additionally, we welcome comments on the presentation
of this material, and suggestions for material that we should develop
in the other book chapters.

Good Luck!
