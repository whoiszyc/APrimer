#+TITLE: PyPSA: Python for Power System Analysis

* About

PyPSA stands for "Python for Power System Analysis". It is pronounced
"pipes-ah".

PyPSA is a [[http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html][free software]] toolbox for simulating and optimising modern
power systems that include features such as conventional generators
with unit commitment, variable wind and solar generation, storage
units, coupling to other energy sectors, and mixed alternating and direct current
networks. PyPSA is designed to scale well with large networks and long
time series.


This project is maintained by the [[https://www.iai.kit.edu/english/2338.php][Energy System Modelling group]] at the
[[https://www.iai.kit.edu/english/index.php][Institute for Automation and Applied Informatics]] at the [[http://www.kit.edu/english/index.php][Karlsruhe
Institute of Technology]]. The group is funded by the [[https://www.helmholtz.de/en/][Helmholtz
Association]] until 2024.  Previous versions were developed by the
[[https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/physics/schramm/renewable-energy-system-and-network-analysis/][Renewable Energy Group]] at [[https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/][FIAS]] to carry out simulations for the
[[http://condynet.de/][CoNDyNet project]], financed by the [[https://www.bmbf.de/en/index.html][German Federal Ministry for
Education and Research (BMBF)]] as part of the [[http://forschung-stromnetze.info/projekte/grundlagen-und-konzepte-fuer-effiziente-dezentrale-stromnetze/][Stromnetze Research
Initiative]].

* What PyPSA does and does not do (yet)

PyPSA can calculate:

-  static power flow (using both the full non-linear network equations
   and the linearised network equations)
-  linear optimal power flow (least-cost optimisation of power plant and storage
   dispatch within network constraints, using the linear network
   equations, over several snapshots)
-  security-constrained linear optimal power flow
-  total electricity/energy system least-cost investment optimisation (using linear
   network equations, over several snapshots simultaneously for
   optimisation of generation and storage dispatch and investment in the
   capacities of generation, storage, transmission and other infrastructure)

It has models for:

-  meshed multiply-connected AC and DC networks, with controllable
   converters between AC and DC networks
-  standard types for lines and transformers following the
   implementation in
   [[https://www.uni-kassel.de/eecs/fachgebiete/e2n/software/pandapower.html][pandapower]]
-  conventional dispatchable generators with unit commitment
-  generators with time-varying power availability, such as wind and
   solar generators
-  storage units with efficiency losses
-  simple hydroelectricity with inflow and spillage
-  coupling with other energy carriers
-  basic components out of which more complicated assets can be built,
   such as Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units, heat pumps, resistive
   Power-to-Heat (P2H), Power-to-Gas (P2G), battery electric vehicles
   (BEVs), Fischer-Tropsch, direct air capture (DAC), etc.; each of
   these is demonstrated in the [[./examples/index.html][examples]]


Functionality that may be added in the future:

- Multi-year investment optimisation
- Distributed active power slack
- Interactive web-based GUI with SVG
- OPF with the full non-linear network equations
- Port to [[http://julialang.org/][Julia]]

Other complementary libraries:

- [[https://github.com/e2nIEE/pandapower][pandapower]] for more detailed modelling of distribution grids,
  short-circuit calculations, unbalanced load flow and more
- [[https://github.com/JuliaEnergy/PowerDynamics.jl][PowerDynamics.jl]] for dynamic modelling of power grids at time scales
  where differential equations are relevant



* Example scripts as Jupyter notebooks

There are [[./examples/index.html][extensive examples]] available as Jupyter notebooks.

Results from a PyPSA simulation can be converted into an interactive
online animation using [[https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA-animation][PyPSA-animation]], see the [[https://www.pypsa.org/animations/pypsa-eur-30/][PyPSA-Eur-30 example]].


Another showcase for PyPSA is the [[https://pypsa.org/examples/scigrid-lopf-then-pf-plotly.html][SciGRID example]] which demonstrates
interactive plots generated with the [[https://plot.ly/python/][plotly]] library.

* What PyPSA uses under the hood

PyPSA is written and tested to be compatible with both Python 2.7 and
Python 3.6.

It leans heavily on the following Python packages:

-  [[http://pandas.pydata.org/][pandas]] for storing data about components and time series
-  [[http://www.numpy.org/][numpy]] and [[http://scipy.org/][scipy]] for calculations, such as linear algebra and sparse
   matrix calculations
-  [[http://www.pyomo.org/][pyomo]] for preparing optimisation problems (currently only linear)
-  [[https://plot.ly/python/][plotly]] for interactive plotting
-  [[https://matplotlib.org/][matplotlib]] for static plotting
-  [[https://networkx.github.io/][networkx]] for some network calculations
-  [[http://pytest.org/][py.test]] for unit testing
-  [[https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html][logging]] for managing messages

The optimisation uses pyomo so that it is independent of the preferred
solver (you can use e.g. the free software GLPK or the commercial
software Gurobi).

The time-expensive calculations, such as solving sparse linear
equations, are carried out using the scipy.sparse libraries.
