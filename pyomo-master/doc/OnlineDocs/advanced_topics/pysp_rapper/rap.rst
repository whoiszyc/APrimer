As homage to the tired clich√© based on the rap-wrap homonym, we provide the lyrics to our rap anthem:

A PySP State of Mind (The Pyomo Hip Hop)

   Yeah, yeah
   Ayo, modeller, it's time.
   It's time, modeller (aight, modeller, begin).
   Straight out the scriptable dungeons of rap.
   
   The cat drops deep as does my map.
   I never program, 'cause to program is the uncle of rap.
   Beyond the walls of scenarios, life is defined.
   I think of optimization under uncertainty when I'm in a PySP state of mind.
   
   Hope the resolution got some institution.
   My revolution don't like no dirty retribution.
   Run up to the distribution and get the evolution.
   
   In a PySP state of mind. 
   
   What more could you ask for? The fast cat?
   You complain about unscriptability.
   I gotta love it though - somebody still speaks for the mat.
   
   I'm rappin' with a cape,
   And I'm gonna move your escape.
   
   Easy, big, indented, like a solution
   Boy, I tell you, I thought you were an institution.
   
   I can't take the unscriptability, can't take the script.
   I woulda tried to code I guess I got no transcript.
   
   Yea, yaz, in a PySP state of mind.
   
   When I was young my uncle had a nondescript.
   I waz kicked out without no manuscript.
   I never thought I'd see that crypt.
   Ain't a soul alive that could take my uncle's transcript.
   
   An object oriented fox is quite the box.
   
   Thinking of optimization under uncertainty.
   Yaz, thinking of optimization under uncertainty
   (optimization under uncertainty).
