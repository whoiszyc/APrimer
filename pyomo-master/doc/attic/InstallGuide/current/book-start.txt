== Preface ==

This book describes different methods for installing the Pyomo
software.  Pyomo is a Python software package that supports a diverse
set of optimization capabilities for formulating and analyzing
optimization models.  This capability is commonly associated with
algebraic modeling languages (AMLs), which support the description
and analysis of mathematical models with a high-level language.

=== Goals of the Book ===

Unfortunately, Pyomo is a complex software package that can be
difficult to install.  Pyomo is a Python package that integrates a
variety of subpackages.  Pyomo also depends on a variety of third-party
Python packages, some of which have very different installation
processes on different computer operating systems.  Furthermore,
Pyomo can execute third-party optimization solvers, whose installation
and configuration is completely independent of Pyomo.

In this book, we outline a variety of installation options for
different computer operating systems and for different usage models.
These installation options reflect the different ways that Pyomo
developers and users have used Pyomo, and they account for user
access to system resources.


=== Comments and Questions ===

Further information about Pyomo and Pyomo is available a the Pyomo home page:

    http://pyomo.org

The Pyomo software is developed on the following Trac site:

    https://software.sandia.gov/trac/pyomo

Pyomo is also hosted at COIN-OR:

    https://projects.coin-or.org/pyomo

We strongly encourage feedback from readers about the software on the Pyomo Forum:

    pyomo-forum@googlegroups.com

We hope this will include feedback on typos and errors in our examples in this book.  

Good Luck!
