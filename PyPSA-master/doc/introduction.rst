 Introduction
##########################################

PyPSA stands for "Python for Power System Analysis". It is pronounced "pipes-ah".

PyPSA is a `free software
<http://www.gnu.org/philosophy/free-sw.en.html>`_ toolbox for
simulating and optimising modern power systems that include features
such as conventional generators with unit commitment, variable wind
and solar generation, storage units, coupling to other energy sectors,
and mixed alternating and direct current networks.  PyPSA is designed
to scale well with large networks and long time series.

This project is maintained by the `Energy System Modelling
group <https://www.iai.kit.edu/english/2338.php>`_ at the `Institute for
Automation and Applied
Informatics <https://www.iai.kit.edu/english/index.php>`_ at the
`Karlsruhe Institute of
Technology <http://www.kit.edu/english/index.php>`_. The group is funded by the
`Helmholtz Association <https://www.helmholtz.de/en/>`_ until 2024.
Previous versions were developed by the `Renewable Energy Group
<https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/physics/schramm/renewable-energy-system-and-network-analysis/>`_
at `FIAS <https://fias.uni-frankfurt.de/>`_ to carry out simulations
for the `CoNDyNet project <http://condynet.de/>`_, financed by the
`German Federal Ministry for Education and Research (BMBF) <https://www.bmbf.de/en/index.html>`_ as part of the `Stromnetze Research Initiative <http://forschung-stromnetze.info/projekte/grundlagen-und-konzepte-fuer-effiziente-dezentrale-stromnetze/>`_.


What PyPSA does and does not do (yet)
=======================================

PyPSA can calculate:

* static power flow (using both the full non-linear network equations and
  the linearised network equations)
* linear optimal power flow (least-cost optimisation of power plant and storage
  dispatch within network constraints, using the linear network
  equations, over several snapshots)
* security-constrained linear optimal power flow
* total electricity/energy system least-cost investment optimisation (using linear
  network equations, over several snapshots simultaneously for
  optimisation of generation and storage dispatch and investment in
  the capacities of generation, storage, transmission and other infrastructure)

It has models for:

* meshed multiply-connected AC and DC networks, with controllable
  converters between AC and DC networks
* standard types for lines and transformers following the implementation in `pandapower <https://www.uni-kassel.de/eecs/fachgebiete/e2n/software/pandapower.html>`_
* conventional dispatchable generators with unit commitment
* generators with time-varying power availability, such as
  wind and solar generators
* storage units with efficiency losses
* simple hydroelectricity with inflow and spillage
* coupling with other energy carriers
* basic components out of which more complicated assets can be built,
  such as Combined Heat and Power (CHP) units, heat pumps, resistive
  Power-to-Heat (P2H), Power-to-Gas (P2G), battery electric vehicles
  (BEVs), Fischer-Tropsch, direct air capture (DAC), etc.; each of
  these is demonstrated in the `examples
  <http://www.pypsa.org/examples/>`_


Functionality that may be added in the future:

* Multi-year investment optimisation
* Distributed active power slack
* Interactive web-based GUI with SVG
* OPF with the full non-linear network equations
* Port to `Julia <http://julialang.org/>`_

Other complementary libraries:

* `pandapower <https://github.com/e2nIEE/pandapower>`_ for more
  detailed modelling of distribution grids, short-circuit
  calculations, unbalanced load flow and more
* `PowerDynamics.jl
  <https://github.com/JuliaEnergy/PowerDynamics.jl>`_ for dynamic
  modelling of power grids at time scales where differential equations are relevant



Example scripts as Jupyter notebooks
====================================

There are `extensive examples <http://www.pypsa.org/examples/>`_
available as Jupyter notebooks. They are also described in the
:doc:`examples` and are available as Python scripts in ``examples/``.


Screenshots
===========


Results from a PyPSA simulation can be converted into an interactive
online animation using `PyPSA-animation
<https://github.com/PyPSA/PyPSA-animation>`_, see the `PyPSA-Eur-30
example <https://www.pypsa.org/animations/pypsa-eur-30/>`_.

Another showcase for PyPSA is the `SciGRID example
<https://pypsa.org/examples/scigrid-lopf-then-pf-plotly.html>`_ which
demonstrates interactive plots generated with the `plotly
<https://plot.ly/python/>`_ library.

Optimised capacities of generation and storage for a 95% reduction in CO2 emissions in Europe compare to 1990 levels:

Target user group
=================

PyPSA is intended for researchers, planners and utilities who need a
fast, easy-to-use and transparent tool for power system
analysis. PyPSA is free software and can be arbitrarily extended.



Other comparable software
=========================

For a full list see :doc:`comparable_software`.

PyPSA is not as fully featured as other power system simulation tools
such as the Matlab-based free software `PSAT
<http://faraday1.ucd.ie/psat.html>`_ or the commercial package
`DIgSILENT PowerFactory
<http://www.digsilent.de/index.php/products-powerfactory.html>`_.

However for power flow and optimal power flow over several time
snapshots with variable renewable energy sources and/or storage and/or
mixed AC-DC systems, it offers the flexibility of Python and the
transparency of free software.

Another Python power system tool is `PYPOWER
<https://github.com/rwl/PYPOWER/>`_, which is based on the
Matlab-based `MATPOWER <http://www.pserc.cornell.edu//matpower/>`_. In
contrast to PYPOWER, PyPSA has an easier-to-use data model (pandas
DataFrames instead of numpy arrays), support for time-varying data
inputs and support for multiply-connected networks using both AC
and DC. PyPSA uses some of the sparse-matrix constructs from PYPOWER.



What PyPSA uses under the hood
===============================

PyPSA is written and tested to be compatible with both Python 2.7 and
Python 3.6.

It leans heavily on the following Python packages:

* `pandas <http://pandas.pydata.org/>`_ for storing data about components and time series
* `numpy <http://www.numpy.org/>`_ and `scipy <http://scipy.org/>`_ for calculations, such as
  linear algebra and sparse matrix calculations
* `pyomo <http://www.pyomo.org/>`_ for preparing optimisation problems (currently only linear)
* `plotly <https://plot.ly/python/>`_ for interactive plotting
* `matplotlib <https://matplotlib.org/>`_ for static plotting
* `networkx <https://networkx.github.io/>`_ for some network calculations
* `py.test <http://pytest.org/>`_ for unit testing
* `logging <https://docs.python.org/3/library/logging.html>`_ for managing messages


The optimisation uses pyomo so that it is independent of the preferred
solver (you can use e.g. the free software GLPK or the commercial
software Gurobi).

The time-expensive calculations, such as solving sparse linear
equations, are carried out using the scipy.sparse libraries.
