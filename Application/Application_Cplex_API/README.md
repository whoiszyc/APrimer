**Cplex Python API Sample File**

In this repository, you can know how to use Cplex Python API to solve 
common mathematical programming problems. I create this repository
 because I have developed the way to import data into the 
 mathematical programming - by using matrices. 
 Further, you can also create the matrices via Database, 
 Excel file or any other file type which you prefer. On the other hand, it is
 not easy to find a good sample on Internet.
