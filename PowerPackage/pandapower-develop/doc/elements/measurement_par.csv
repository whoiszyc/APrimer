**Parameter**;**Datatype**;**Value Range**;**Explanation**
type;string;"| ""p""
| ""q""
| ""i""
| ""v""";Defines what physical quantity is measured
element_type;string;"| ""bus""
| ""line""
| ""transformer""";Defines which element type is equipped with the measurement
value;float;;Measurement value
std_dev;float;;Standard deviation (same unit as measurement)
bus;int;"| must be in 
| net.bus.index";"Defines the bus at which the measurement is placed. 
For line or transformer measurement it defines the side at which the measurement is placed (from_bus or to_bus)."
element;int;"| must be in 
| net.line.index or
| net.trafo.index";"If the element_type is ""line"" or ""transformer"", element is the index of the relevant element. For ""bus"" measurements it is None (default)"
check_existing;bool;;Checks if a measurement of the type already exists and overwrites it. If set to False, the measurement may be added twice (unsafe behaviour), but the performance increases
index;int;;Defines a specific index for the new measurement (if possible)
