PyPSA has a Google Group `forum / mailing list
<https://groups.google.com/group/pypsa>`_.

Anyone can join and anyone can read the posts; only members of the
group can post to the list.


The intention is to have a place where announcements of new releases
can be made and to discuss issues and suggest/contribute features for
future development.
