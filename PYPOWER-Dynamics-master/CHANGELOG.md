- Added option in machines file to use user-defined MVA base for machine parameters (impedances and inertia). Parameters are converted to 100MVA base during setup.
- Added version information
- Added STATE event for changine state variables during a simulation
- Speed-voltage term in current injections for synchronous machines is now an option (rather than always enforced)
